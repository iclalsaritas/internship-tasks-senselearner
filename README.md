##### It is likely that any system, process, website, device, etc. can be vulnerable to an attack. To understand how a computer hacker could operate and what the damage could be, ethical hackers should think like malicious hackers and be aware of the tools and techniques they might use.

###### These techniques can include:

###### Web Application Hacking
###### System Hacking
###### Web Server Hacking
###### Wireless Network Hacking
###### Social Engineering

###### Ethical Hacking Phases
###### Planning and Reconnaissance
###### The first step in ethical hacking is defining the scope and objectives of a test and identifying the test methods to be followed. It also involves gathering intelligence to understand potential security vulnerabilities and how a target operates. Future footprinting is done using footprinting tools on search engines, web services, social network sites, DNS, email, networks, etc.

###### Scanning
###### In the second step, scanning is performed to understand how the target responds to various unauthorized entry attempts - when the application's code is static and when the application's code is running. Understanding the application's performance in real-time is the most practical way.

###### Gaining Access
###### This is a crucial step in which a web application is attacked by exploiting security vulnerabilities using techniques like SQL injections, cross-site scripting, backdoors, etc., and then gaining unauthorized access. It involves stealing security vulnerabilities, intercepting traffic, and understanding the extent of damage that can be inflicted.

###### Maintaining Access
###### In this penetration testing step, the security vulnerability is used as a long-lasting asset in the compromised system to steal sensitive information, propagate through the network, and quickly gain access to the server.

###### Analysis
###### The final stage of a penetration test involves compiling results by analyzing and interpreting the exploited security vulnerabilities, data access, and the time the testing device can remain undetected within the system.
